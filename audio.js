  audio.js
  --------
  Shared audio helper used by every 🔊 Listen button (lesson.js, review.js,
  glossary.js).

  Progressive enhancement, no data file changes needed:
  1. First, it tries to play a real recorded clip from:
       audio/<slug-of-latin-word>.mp3
     One recording per unique word, in a single flat "audio" folder, if
     the same word appears in multiple lessons, you only record it once.
     Save a clip at that exact path and the site plays your real voice
     automatically; nothing else to wire up.
  2. If that file doesn't exist yet, it silently falls back to the
     browser's built-in text-to-speech reading the phonetic
     "pronunciation" guide. That's an approximation, not a substitute
     for a native speaker, but means every word is at least audible
     right away, and gradually gets replaced as you record more.

  Filename convention (must match exactly, all lowercase):
    - Lowercase the word's "latin" spelling
    - Replace anything that isn't a-z or 0-9 with a single hyphen
    - Trim leading/trailing hyphens
    e.g. "Wach 3andkom wifi?" -> "wach-3andkom-wifi"
  recording-checklist.md lists the exact expected filename for every word.
